### Budget recorder

* Purpose:   
A Budget class which is able to create different categories and supports multiple methods: spend_record, deposit, get_balance and export to csv .
Another Analyze class takes a Budget object as an argument, its methods would analyze data of a specific period of time and produce charts to let you better know your financial condition.

* Concepts:   
Currently use list to record each transaction.(in future this will be replaced by sql database).
The Pandas (and Numpy) lib is used for filter, drop and aggregate data, while Matplotlib for visualization.
