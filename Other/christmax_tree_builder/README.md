### Chrismas tree builder

* Purpose:  
This program could produce a html code that presents a customized christmas tree with random decorations on it. Just paste on note and save it into .html, or paste on anywhere on your html code. And you will see your beautiful christmas tree.

* Concepts:  
Create several lines with ascending width and random color decorations by random module. Then concatenate each line and formatting it to produce html code.
You can customize the height(lines of the tree body), color of the tree/star/decorations, and text on it.
