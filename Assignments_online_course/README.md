### arithmetic formatter

* Purpose: a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side.
* Concepts: 
Scan every char of problems and split strings into *operand operater operand* format while check if any char violates the rules (eg: value isn't numerical). Use *ljust* *rjust* to ensure the alignment of each line.
* Preview:
    ```
   >> arithmetic_arranger(["32 - 698", "1 - 3801", "45 + 43", "123 + 49"], True)
       32         1      45      123
    - 698    - 3801    + 43    +  49
    -----    ------    ----    -----
     -666     -3800      88      172
